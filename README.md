Express API sample project

This is a simple Express.js sample project and a good starting point for those wanting to create a REST API using Express.js.

This project uses sample data that is hardcoded when accessing the REST API endpoints.

Client side views of the REST API are rendered with the Jade (now Pug) templating engine.
